  "readme": "# Hamburger\n\nA CSS-only implementation of the layered slide-in UI menu concept popularized by Facebook, Google and Mailbox. Inspired by Hakim's [Meny](https://github.com/hakimel/meny) and powered by CSS3.\n\n## Introduction\n\nVerethragna manages and displays lectures in accordance with openlectures production guidelines and specifications. The database is bidirectionally synchronized to Google Drive. Subsequent updates will allow advanced user-tracking and extensive third-party API integration\n\n## Quick Start\n\nHamburger is registered on [Bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower). To install via Bower:\n\n```bash\nbower install hamburger\n```\n\nIf that's not your cup of tea, clone the repository to a local directory and you're ready to rock and roll!\n\n## Using Hamburger\n\nAdd ```_hamburger.scss``` to your stylesheet by importing it into your main encapsulation file\n\n```scss\n@import \"hamburger\";\n```\n\nHamburger targets the HTML5 ```nav``` and ```main``` elements for implementation of the sliding functionality. Any navigation or content you want to keep off-canvas goes inside ```nav```. Everything else that should remain onscreen goes inside ```main```.\n\nHere's a sample document layout:\n```html\n<body>\n  <nav>\n    Menu Item 1\n    Menu Item 2\n    Menu Item 3\n  </nav>\n  <main>\n    Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet\n  </main>\n</body>\n```\n\nIf you wish to have the navigation menu appear to move towards the front of the screen as it slides in (like how it's done in Mailbox), put your navigations inside a menu item:\n```html\n<nav>\n  <menu>\n    Menu Item 1\n    Menu Item 2\n    Menu Item 3\n  </menu>\n</nav>\n```\n\nNote that in all cases, the ```main``` element has to come after the ```nav``` element for the animation to work properly (we're using the CSS adjacent selector to make the magic happen).\n\nIf you need to provide support for browsers without HTML5 support, you should use the [html5shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) to implement the ```nav```,```menu``` and ```main``` elements.\n\n## Versioning\n\nDevelopment will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible in order to ensure transparency and backwards compatibility.\n\nReleases will be numbered with the following format:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\n\nAnd constructed with the following guidelines:\n\n+ Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)\n+ New additions without breaking backward compatibility bump the minor (and resets the patch)\n+ Bug fixes and miscellaneous changes bump the patch\n\nFor more information on SemVer, visit http://semver.org/.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n+ Add CSS and SASS versions\n+ Give users greater control over features like opacity and scaling\n+ Add stylized documentation\n+ Add more samples (e.g with backgrounds or shadows)\n\n## Bug Tracking and Feature Requests\n\nHave a bug or a feature request?
